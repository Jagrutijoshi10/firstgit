			 <div>ABC Public Schools ardently believe that Education is a process and not a product.
			 Swami Chinmayananda once said : 'Children are not vessels to be filled but lamps to be lit'. 
			 One of the mission statements of the school is that a rigorous academic program would be ensured, coupled with a rich repertoire of Co-curricular and Extra-curricular activities, allowing latent talents to bloom in a nurturing, non-threatening environment. 
			 Here, 'All the students will experience Success which is essential in building Self-esteem'. 
			 The objective of the school is to leave the legacy of overall development in the students, endow them with a much-needed holistic education and give them a competitive edge over their counterparts elsewhere, thus molding them into worthy citizens of a global village. . .
